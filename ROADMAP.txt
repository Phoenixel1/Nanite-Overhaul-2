This is a rough roadmap that needs to be fleshed out. 

Any changes please discuss in the discord.

1.) Balance changes to account for incoming bigger changes

2.) Remake features - Nanite worlds, Nanite ahrvesters, tooltips and resources pipelines

3.) New origins, traits, civics etc 

4.) Start work on crisis path and any other large vents. 

5.) Precursor
