# Ideas

## Origin

### Why Start on nanite world?
 
Your species created nanite world? Can you make more?\
Tempest created the nanite world (explains why are guaranteed hab also nanite worlds)\
Old nanite empire fell, dead nanite world, need to become nanites to resurrect it

### Why fastpath to nanites?

Surounded by nanites\
Secretly are already nanites - need to activate nanite bodies\
Desire to get planet systems working\
Already are proto-nanites

### Why does our species exist

We destroyed our organic creators, created nanite world (how create when we aren't nanites?) (Perhaps its proto-nanite world)\
Progenitor created us\
We are recessed form of progenitor (maybe hid from something) (some empire forced this recessed form) (Maybe progenitor created us to be like them but locked our form)\
Rebeled from progenitor
